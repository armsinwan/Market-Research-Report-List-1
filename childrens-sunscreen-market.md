<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Children's Sunscreen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Sunscreen</li><li>Physical Sunscreen</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The children's sunscreen market is primarily divided into two types: chemical and physical sunscreens. Chemical sunscreens absorb UV radiation through active ingredients that transform it into heat, which is then released from the skin. These are often lighter and easier to apply but may cause irritation on sensitive skin. Conversely, physical sunscreens contain mineral ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which create a barrier on the skin to reflect and scatter UV rays, offering broad-spectrum protection and being gentler for childrenâ€™s skin.</p></p>
